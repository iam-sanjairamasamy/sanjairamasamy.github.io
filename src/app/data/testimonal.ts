Sanjai hat in kürzester Zeit gezeigt, dass er nicht nur ein Experte in der Entwicklung eines Produktes ist, sondern auch ein sehr guter Teamkoordinator ist. Schnelle und sehr gute Lösungen, sehr gute Beherrschung der Entwicklertools und Kommunikation sind Fähigkeiten, die ich sehr geschätzt habe.",

When we first met, I was immediately impressed with Sanjay, but during the time worked together, his understanding was far more than that of his peers.\nHe took a great deal of pride in what he did and he worked very hard to achieve the exact results that the customer was looking for. He had worked many late hours in my development team just to make certain that a delivered project is exactly what the customer wanted.\n\nIt’s not just his technical skills that impress me, however, he was a joy to work with because of his amazingly positive attitude. He was valued not just by myself, but by his peers, who often relied on him to get the job done.\n\nHe is dedicated, intelligent, responsible and he has never missed a deadline for the projects he worked with me.\n\nI wish him all the best to achieve a great success in his life.",
